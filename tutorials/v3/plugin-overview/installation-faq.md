# Installation FAQ



### I see this error on installation - The type or namespace name 'Newtonsoft' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?

The plugin depends on Newtonsoft's json plugin which needs to be added to your packages.

Add the following dependencies in YOUR\_PROJECT\_ROOT/Packages/manifest.json under dependencies block

```json
"com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json": "2.0.0"
```

> Any version â‰¥ 2.0.0 is fine.
