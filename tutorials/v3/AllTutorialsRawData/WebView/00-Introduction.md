# Web View - Introduction

Welcome to the Web View tutorial! This tutorial is part of the Essential Kit tutorial series from Voxel Busters.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive tutorial series, you'll master:

- Creating and configuring web view instances for Unity mobile games
- Loading web content from URLs, HTML strings, and raw data
- Customizing web view appearance with different styles and properties
- Handling web view events and lifecycle management
- Executing JavaScript and communicating between Unity and web content
- Managing web view navigation, caching, and performance

## Why Web View Matters for Unity Mobile Game Developers

Web View is essential for Unity mobile games that need to display web content within the app. Common use cases include in-game news feeds, help documentation, terms of service, community forums, social media integration, and web-based mini-games. 

Instead of redirecting players to external browsers (which breaks the game experience), Web View keeps users engaged within your Unity iOS and Unity Android games while providing full web functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Unity 2021.3.45f1 or later
- Essential Kit properly configured in your Unity project
- Basic understanding of Unity UI system and event handling
- Familiarity with web technologies (HTML, JavaScript) is helpful but not required

## Platform Setup

**Excellent news!** Essential Kit handles all the complex native web view setup automatically for both iOS and Android platforms. No need to manually configure:

- iOS WKWebView initialization and delegate management
- Android WebView settings and JavaScript bridges
- Cross-platform event handling and lifecycle management
- Native UI integration and threading considerations
- Memory management and performance optimizations

Essential Kit abstracts away platform complexities so you can focus on delivering great web experiences in your Unity mobile games!

The only setup you might need is ensuring your web content complies with platform policies and privacy requirements.
