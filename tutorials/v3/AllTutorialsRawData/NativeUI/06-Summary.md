# Native UI - Summary

This tutorial series covered Essential Kit's Native UI components, providing you with the knowledge to implement professional native user interface elements in your Unity mobile games.

## What Was Learned

You've mastered two essential Native UI components:

**Alert Dialogs** - Create native popup dialogs with custom titles, messages, buttons, and text input fields. Perfect for confirmations, user input forms, and important notifications.

**Date Pickers** - Implement native date and time selection with multiple modes, constraints, and timezone handling. Ideal for scheduling, event planning, and temporal game features.

## Why It's Useful for Unity Mobile Games

Native UI components provide authentic platform experiences that users expect, improving your game's polish and professionalism. They handle complex platform differences automatically while maintaining consistent APIs across iOS and Android.

## Platform Notes

Essential Kit's Native UI abstracts platform complexities while preserving native behavior. iOS components use UIAlertController and UIDatePicker, while Android uses AlertDialog and DatePickerDialog with Material Design styling. The Unity Editor provides simulator implementations for development and testing.
