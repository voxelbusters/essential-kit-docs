### üìå Important: Platform Refund & Entitlement Behavior

**Google Play**

* When issuing a refund via the Google Play Console for **non-consumables** or **subscriptions**:
  * You **must enable "Revoke entitlement"** for the app to detect the refund.
  * If enabled:
    * `IsProductPurchased(productId)` ‚Üí `false`
    * User‚Äôs entitlement will be removed.

**Apple App Store**

* On iOS, when a refund is processed by Apple (usually via **App Store Support** or user refund requests):
  * **Automatically revoked** ‚Äî no manual revoke option needed.
  * The product will **not appear in subsequent `RestorePurchases` calls**.
  * `IsProductPurchased(productId)` will also return `false`.
  * Works seamlessly for **non-consumables** and **subscriptions**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
‚ö†Ô∏è **Consumables on both platforms**:\
Refunds can be processed, but once consumed, they‚Äôre not restorable and entitlement status cannot be tracked post-consumption. \
\
If you really want to track these purchases, for every entitlement you provide to the user of a purchase, log the transaction id and check from your backend if the purchase is revoked or still valid. Based on that you can control refunds for consumable purchases.
