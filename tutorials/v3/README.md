### Upgrade Strategy & Pricing Overview

We provide ongoing updates to ensure the plugin stays in line with evolving platform guidelines, OS requirements, and industry standards. To keep the product latest and supported, we charge a minimal upgrade fee for each major version release.

Upgrade Pricing History:

   1. Lifespan: 5 years of support and free upgrades&#x20;
   2. Upgrade to V2: <=$50&#x20;
   3. [V2 vs V1](https://assetstore.essentialkit.voxelbusters.com/v2/version-2-vs-version-1)&#x20;
   4. Approx. cost breakdown: $10 per year based on the 5-year lifespan of V1.
2. **V2 (Released 2020, Deprecated 2024)**
   1. Lifespan: 4 years of support and free upgrades&#x20;
   2. Upgrade to V3: <=$40&#x20;

   4. Approx. cost breakdown: \~$10 per year based on the 4-year lifespan of V2.

#### How the Upgrade Fee Works:

* The $10-$15 per year is an average upgrade cost for the lifespan of each major version.
* For example, when upgrading from V1 to V2, the $50 upgrade fee covers the full 5-year lifespan of V1 + additional features in V2, averaging $10 per year.
* When upgrading from V2 to V3, the $40 upgrade fee covers the 4-year lifespan of V2, averaging $10 per year.

### Why Choose Us?

* Custom-coded and privacy-first: We donâ€™t rely on third-party plugins, ensuring full control over your productâ€™s functionality and privacy.
* Fast updates: Weâ€™re often the first to integrate updates for native libraries (e.g., StoreKit 2, Billing Client V6, V7).
* Extensive automation: Includes features like manifest generation, dependency handling, and build post-processing.
* Future plans: Weâ€™re working on open-sourcing major parts of the plugin to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure long-term flexibility.

**If you are upgrading from version 2.x, please follow** [**this guide**](whats-new-in-v3/upgrade-from-v2.md)**.**
