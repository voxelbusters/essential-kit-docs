## What You'll Learn

* Open app store pages for reviews, cross-promotion, and updates
* Direct users to system settings when permissions are denied
* Handle platform-specific app identifiers correctly

## Why Utilities Matters

* **Business impact**: Drive ratings and cross-promote companion apps
* **UX impact**: Help users fix permission issues without confusion
* **Technical impact**: No custom native code for store links or settings access

## Tutorial Roadmap

1. [Setup](setup.md) - Enable utilities and configure app store IDs
2. [Usage](usage.md) - Store pages and application settings APIs
3. [Testing](testing.md) - Verify navigation on both platforms

## Key Use Cases

* Open app store page to encourage ratings and reviews
* Navigate to companion app or DLC listings for cross-promotion
* Guide users to system settings after permission denial
* Direct users to app settings for manual permission grants

## Prerequisites

* Unity project with Essential Kit v3 installed
* iOS App Store ID (numeric) or Android package name configured
* Test devices to verify store and settings navigation
