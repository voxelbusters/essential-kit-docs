## Common

### What are settings required for making Game Services to work?

#### Android

* Play Services Application Id
* [Add SHA Fingerprint for the APK in Google Play Console](setup/android.md#configuring-credentials-sha-fingerprint-authentication)

#### iOS

* Make sure Game Services capability is enabled when you create your app id manually in iOS developer portal

## Android

### What are different SHA fingerprints that needs to be used for logging in successfully on different environments and how to create them?

Each keystore is linked to a SHA fingerprint. Please check below for creating SHA fingerprints on each environment (Debug, Release and Google play)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Debug (Development Mode)" %}
When development mode is enabled in Build Settings on Unity, it always uses defualt debug.keystore.\


{% code title="Command for getting SHA fingerprint" %}
```bash
  keytool -list -v -keystore "PATH_TO_DEBUG_KEYSTORE" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```
{% endcode %}

Check the below table to get  **PATH\_TO\_DEBUG\_KEYSTORE** (debug.keystore)

| Platform | Path                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | <p>C:\Users\USERNAME\.android\debug.keystore</p><p>(Replace with your username in the above path)</p> |
| MacOSX   | \~/.android/debug.keystore                                                                            |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Release (Release Mode)" %}
When development mode is **OFF** its considered to be in release mode. And unity uses the keystore you set in the player settings.

{% code title="Command for getting SHA fingerprint" %}
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore "PATH_TO_KEYSTORE" -alias ALIAS_NAME -storepass STORE_PASSWORD -keypass KEY_PASSWORD
```
{% endcode %}

**PATH\_TO\_KEYSTORE** : This is the path of the keystore you created for your app.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Google Play Store (Alpha/Beta/Production)" %}
Once you upload your apk to play console, you are given an option to let google sign your apk. This is usually called google play signing and its **recommended** to enable it.\
\
Once your app is ready for testing through testing tracks(Alpha/Beta) or production, you need to add the SHA fingerprint once your app signs with google play signing. You can fetch this fingerprint by following below steps

1. Navigate to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish) and select your app
2. Select Setup and click on App Signing. Under **App signing key certificate** copy the value of SHA-1 certificate fingerprint
3. Use this fingerprint value in the [credentials section to create a new oauth client id](setup/android.md#configuring-credentials-sha-fingerprint-authentication).\

### Why is sign-in failing? **Or**

### **In the logs I see "**_**APP NOT CORRECTLY CONFIGURED TO USE GOOGLE PLAY GAME SERVICES**_**". How to solve this?**

This usually happens for one of the 3 main reasons.

1. Your package name and certificate fingerprint do not match the client ID you registered in Developer Console. **This means you haven't added the required SHA fingerprint correctly. You need to copy the printed SHA1 fingerprint  in the logcat log and** [**add it in the credentials section of google play console.**](setup/android.md#adding-a-sha-fingerprint)\

2. Your Play Services Application Id was incorrectly entered in [Essential Kit Settings](setup/#properties)\

3. In sandbox mode, the user you are trying to login is not added as a tester in your App's google play console under Play Games Services -> Setup and Management -> Testers

{% hint style="danger" %}
Nearly 99% of the sign in errors are due to not adding the correct credential for the keystore that is used in Google Play Console-> Your App -> Play Games Services -> Setup and Management -> Configuration.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

For logging in successfully, you need to create the credential by setting the right SHA fingerprint on google play console. Please check setup [here](setup/android.md#configuring-credentials-sha-fingerprint-authentication).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are sure the SHA fingerprints are setup correctly, make sure your testing email account is listed in the play services testers list in google play console.
{% endhint %}

### How to get SHA fingerprint from an APK?

You can use the below command for getting the SHA fingerprint quickly

```bash
keytool -printcert -jarfile PATH_TO_APK_FILE
```

### Why am I getting "keytool command not found"?

You need to have your **JAVA\_HOME** environment variable set on windows or java should be in the PATH on mac.

**keytool** is a program from java sdk and you need to have java setup correctly to get it detected. Its used for getting SHA fingerprint from keystore or an APK.

## iOS

### Why the sign-in dialog doesn't come up second time post user cancelling the sign-in first time?

This is an issue at iOS level which we don't have control. It's a limitation with Game Center and it won't show up the sign-in prompt once user cancels it earlier.

To resolve, user needs to manually sign-in from the settings of his device.
