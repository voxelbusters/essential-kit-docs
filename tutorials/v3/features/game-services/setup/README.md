On iOS, there is a feature to move leaderboards and achievements to groups. Considering you may deploy your game to other platforms(OSX) in future, its good to move them to groups from start. This avoids changing them later once you have your other versions live.

Achievements/Leaderboards  in groups need to start with "grp." prefix and should be unique. We suggest to follow something like **"grp.com.companyname.gamename.leaderboardname"**. Ex: "grp.com.voxelbusters.flappybird.highscoreleaderboard"
