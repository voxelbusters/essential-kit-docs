# 📆 Native UI

Essential Kit's Native UI feature provides platform-native alert dialogs and date/time pickers without maintaining platform-specific code. This tutorial walks you through creating professional UI components that feel native to each platform.

## What You'll Learn

* Create alert dialogs with multiple buttons and text input fields
* Build date and time pickers for user input collection
* Handle dialog callbacks and user interactions properly
* Design platform-appropriate UI flows

## Why Native UI Matters

* **Business impact**: Professional dialogs increase user trust and engagement
* **UX impact**: Native components feel familiar and match platform conventions
* **Technical impact**: No custom native UI code needed across iOS and Android

## Tutorial Roadmap

1. [Setup](setup.md) - Enable Native UI feature
2. [Usage](usage.md) - Alert dialogs, date pickers, and input handling
3. [Testing](testing.md) - Validate on both platforms
4. [FAQ](faq.md) - Troubleshoot common issues

## Key Use Cases

* Show confirmation dialogs for important actions (purchases, deletions, exits)
* Collect user input through native text fields and dialogs
* Let users pick dates for scheduling (tournaments, reminders, events)
* Display time pickers for notification settings and alarm features
* Create multi-button dialogs for complex decision flows

## Prerequisites

* Unity project with Essential Kit v3 installed and Native UI feature included
* iOS or Android build targets for testing native appearances
* Understanding of callback patterns for async dialog interactions
