# Handling Conflicts & Synchronization

Cloud Services in Essential Kit let you save and retrieve simple key-value pairs that automatically sync between local and cloud storage. Itâ€™s designed to be simple, fast, and reliable â€“ with built-in support for detecting conflicts during synchronization.

Letâ€™s explore how it works using an example.

***

### ðŸŽ® Use Case: Saving Player Settings

Imagine youâ€™re working on a game where the player can configure their settings â€“ like the selected language, sound volume, or preferred difficulty. You want to store these preferences in the cloud, so that if the player installs the game on another device, their settings come along.

#### Step 1: Save Settings to Cloud

Letâ€™s assume the player updates their preferred language setting.

```csharp
CloudServices.SetString("player.language", "en");
```

This will **immediately update the local cache** with the value `"en"` for the key `player.language`. At this point, the value is still only available locally â€“ it has not yet been pushed to the cloud.

> âœ… Tip: All `Set*` methods update local cache immediately.

***

#### Step 2: Synchronize with Cloud

When you want to push or pull the latest data to/from the cloud, call:

```csharp
csharpCopyEditCloudServices.Synchronize();
```

This will:

* Fetch the latest copy of cloud data.
* Compare the local and cloud versions.
* Detect if any keys have changed in both locations since last sync.

If a **conflict** is detected (i.e., both local and cloud versions were modified), Essential Kit **overwrites the local value** with the cloud copy and triggers an event **CloudServices.OnSavedDataChange**

***

#### Step 3: Handle Conflict in `OnSavedDataChange`

You can listen for this event and inspect which keys had conflicting values:

```csharp
void OnSavedDataChange(string[] changedKeys)
{
    //ðŸ“Œ Important: CloudServices.GetString(key) here now returns the cloud value, since the local cache has already been updated.
    for (int i = 0; i < changedKeys.Length; i++)
    {
        string key = changedKeys[i];
        string cloudValue;
        string localCacheValue;

        // Retrieve both cloud and local values before the overwrite
        CloudServicesUtility.TryGetCloudAndLocalCacheValues(key, out cloudValue, out localCacheValue, "default");

        Debug.LogFormat("[{0}] Key: {1}\n  [Cloud Value]: {2}\n  [Local Cache Value before overwrite]: {3}", i, key, cloudValue, localCacheValue);

        // Decide what to do: Keep cloud version or restore local
        if (ShouldKeepLocalValue(key, localCacheValue, cloudValue))
        {
            // Restore the local value
            CloudServices.SetString(key, localCacheValue);
            //Calling CloudServices.GetString here will return localCacheValue as we updated with SetString
        }
    }
}
```

***

#### Step 4: Finalize with `SynchronizeComplete`

After the sync is completed (and any conflict resolution is done), the `SynchronizeComplete` event fires:

```csharp
CloudServices.OnSynchronizeComplete += () => 
{
    Debug.Log("Cloud sync complete.");
};
```

If you restored a value during conflict resolution using `SetString`, the updated value will be pushed to the cloud on the next sync cycle â€“ either manually triggered or automatically (e.g., app going to background).

### âš¡ Quick Recap

| Action                           | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SetString("key", value)`        | Immediately updates local cache                                           |
| `Synchronize()`                  | Syncs data, resolves conflicts, and fires events                          |
| `OnSavedDataChange`              | Fires **after a conflict**, providing keys that were overwritten by cloud |
| `TryGetCloudAndLocalCacheValues` | Lets you inspect both the cloud and previous local values                 |
| `SetString(...)` inside event    | Lets you restore the local value if cloud data is not what you want       |
| `OnSynchronizeComplete`          | Fires after sync and conflict resolution is done                          |

### Example Conflict Flow

Letâ€™s say:

1. Player changes `"player.language"` to `"en"` locally.
2. On another device, the same key is changed to `"fr"`.
3. Player syncs both devices.

During sync, the cloud value `"fr"` is fetched and overwrites the local `"en"`, triggering `OnSavedDataChange`. Now you can use the utility function `CloudServicesUtility.TryGetCloudAndLocalCacheValues` to retrieve both the cloud value (`"fr"`) and the old local value (`"en"`), allowing you to decide whether to keep the cloud version or restore your original local data.
