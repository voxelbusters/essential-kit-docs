# Testing

Plugin provides editor simulation to quickly test your implementation on Unity Editor.&#x20;

This will come handy if you don't have access to a device or you just want to bypass a certain native feature.

Set the access status to value of **AddressBookContactsAccessStatus** and it should act as per the set status while running on editor.
