# Billing Services

Essential Kit's Billing Services feature lets Unity teams monetize mobile games with in-app purchases without maintaining platform-specific code. This tutorial walks you through setup, key APIs, testing, and troubleshooting so you can add consumables, non-consumables, and subscriptions with confidence.

## What You'll Learn
- Configure products in Essential Kit Settings and platform stores (App Store Connect, Google Play Console)
- Initialize the store connection and retrieve localized product pricing
- Purchase products and handle transaction states (success, failure, deferred, restored)
- Restore purchases for non-consumables and subscriptions
- Finish transactions and manage pending purchases (advanced server verification)

## Why Billing Services Matters
- **Revenue Generation**: Primary monetization driver for mobile games with secure, native purchase flows
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Single API works across iOS App Store and Google Play Store
- **Security Built-In**: Local receipt verification on iOS (StoreKit2), optional server verification for Android
- **App Store Compliance**: Automatic platform setup with restore functionality required by Apple guidelines

## Tutorial Roadmap
1. [Setup](setup/) - Configure products in Essential Kit Settings and platform stores
2. [Usage](usage.md) - Initialize store, purchase products, restore purchases, handle transactions
3. [Testing](testing/) - Test with sandbox accounts and validate on devices
4. [FAQ](faq.md) - Troubleshoot common purchase and configuration issues

## Key Use Cases

### Sell Virtual Goods
Use consumable products to sell in-game items like coins, gems, lives, or power-ups that players can purchase repeatedly. Offer multiple value tiers ($0.99, $4.99, $9.99) to maximize revenue across different player segments.

### Premium Upgrades
Sell permanent features with non-consumable products like ad removal, character unlocks, or premium level packs. Once purchased, these items are owned forever and automatically restored across devices.

### Subscriptions
Implement VIP memberships, battle passes, or season passes with recurring billing. Offer flexible durations (weekly, monthly, yearly) with introductory offers and free trials to increase conversion.

### Multi-Currency Systems
Support multiple virtual currencies (coins, gems, tickets) using payout definitions. A single purchase can grant multiple currency types for complex economy systems.

### Remove Ads
Offer an ad-free experience with a non-consumable product. Use `IsProductPurchased()` to check ownership status and hide ads permanently for paying users.

## Prerequisites
- Unity project with Essential Kit v3 installed and Billing Services feature included in the build
- **iOS**: App Store Connect account with products configured and banking information complete
- **Android**: Google Play Console account with products configured and app uploaded for testing
- Test device or sandbox accounts to validate purchases before release
