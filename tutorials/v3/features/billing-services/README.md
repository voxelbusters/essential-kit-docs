### Use-cases

### Sell Virtual Goods

Use in-app purchases (Consumable/Non-Consumable) to sell in-game items or levels of your game which gives them an added advantage. This can be achieved indirectly too by allowing them to buy virtual coins and exchange them for in-game items.

### Sell Subscriptions

Utilize subscriptions to provide players with ongoing benefits or premium features. This could include access to exclusive content, special items, or enhanced game mechanics. Offer flexible subscription plans (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly) to cater to different player needs and engage them with continuous updates and rewards to maintain their interest and justify the subscription value.

### Option for Removing Ads

Use in-app purchases (Non-Consumable) to let user pay for ad-free experience.
