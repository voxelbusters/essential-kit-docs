## Billing Products

Billing product is a container to hold your in-app purchase identifiers for different platforms. Each billing product has a unique **Id** to identify them. Id helps in referring an in-app purchase from your code irrespective of the platform you are on and this can be any string of your choice.

Platform Id on the other hand, is the actual platform specific identifier and usually varies per platform. Specify the value in platform overrides, if you don't have a common identifier among platforms.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get **platform id** value from [iTunes Connect](ios.md#create-an-in-app-purchase) and [Google Play console](android.md#create-in-app-products) on  iOS and Android respectively.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
